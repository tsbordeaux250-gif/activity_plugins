    <h1>Exploring WordPress Customization</h1>
<p>My name is Tylon Bordeaux. The date is November 3rd, 2025.</p>
<p>For my Theme, I chose Astra supports many different important factors, such as a modular interface, as well as documentation on how to use all of these modules, Such as WooCommerce, Site Layouts, or Typography. </p>
<p>The Plug-In I chose was "Gutenberg." For me, I found this to be a very interesting plug-in, as for site creation, I'd love to toy around with new, cutting edge site and block customization options. </p>
